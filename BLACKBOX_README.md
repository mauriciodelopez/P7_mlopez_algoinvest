# Python Virtual Environment Activation Script for PowerShell

This script activates a Python virtual environment for the current PowerShell session. It does this by:

1. Adding the virtual environment's Python executable to the front of the `$Env:PATH` environment variable.
2. Setting the prompt to signify that you are in a Python virtual environment.
3. Making use of the command line switches as well as the `pyvenv.cfg` file values present in the virtual environment.

### Usage

To use this script, simply run it from the PowerShell prompt. You can optionally specify the path to the virtual environment directory as a parameter. For example:

```
.\Activate.ps1
```

or

```
.\Activate.ps1 -VenvDir C:\Users\MyUser\Common\.venv
```

### Parameters

The script supports the following parameters:

* `-VenvDir`: The path to the directory that contains the virtual environment to activate. The default value for this is the parent of the directory that the `Activate.ps1` script is located within.
* `-Prompt`: The prompt prefix to display when this virtual environment is activated. By default, this prompt is the name of the virtual environment folder (VenvDir) surrounded by parentheses and followed by a single space (ie. '(.venv) ').

### Functions

The script defines the following functions:

* `deactivate()`: Removes all shell session elements added by the Activate script, including the addition of the virtual environment's Python executable from the beginning of the `PATH` variable.
* `Get-PyVenvConfig()`: Parses the values from the `pyvenv.cfg` file located in the given folder, and returns them in a map.
